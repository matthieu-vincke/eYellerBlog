This blog has been created thanks to the <a href="https://github.com/creationix/wheat/" target="_blank">Wheat engine</a> created by [Tim Caswell](https://twitter.com/creationix).

And also thanks to the instructions given in the article:

##What is eYeller
eYeller is a localised micro messages engine. You can send messages to people around you, create events etc.
eYeller is based on "yells". A "yell" is a localised message with a limited lifespan. The message can be "re-yelled" and then, propagated as a real yell.

The development is still on going. We are using nodejs for the server and mongodb for the database.
For the mobile part (android and ios), we are using html5 / javascript and phonegap.

##Purpose of this blog
During the development of eYeller, we discovered plenty of new things we didn't know. We will try to show most of them in this blog.
